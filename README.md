# Robust Sounds Record Label

This website is for a London based underground record label/collective, that focuses on creating and promoting hip hop, jazz lofi and a wide variety of music. The prime focus and intention for this website is to provide the client with a platform to document and showcase their content. Furthermore, gain a greater rapport with new and already existing fans, increase sells and widen the global reach of the label itself.

After multiple discussions with the owner of the brand we were able to agree upon a simple but effective website that would sufficiently serve their purpose. Originally their proposal was to have a page that displayed contact information and insight into the members of their label, from the founders, to the artists and producers that were later signed. However I proposed that organising a discography of both new and old tracks on the website would appeal to all users. As a label that is intending to expand its reach, showcasing an organised discography is essential in bringing collaborators, event planners and promoters to the table. In addition, colours and design that reflect the label itself would be very effective for new and frequent users as this would create a clear identity for the label and website itself. Many viewers are from artistic and musical backgrounds so the use of imagery is just as important. Including eye opening and thought provoking imagery is essential to creating a connection with these viewers.

I informed the client that due to the variety of user types the website will bring I would create a front end site that caters to all viewers:

# Landing Page User Story

+ As an existing fan of the label, the landing page must provide easy navigation to pages like "Discography and Merchandise" as this  the main interest for this specific user.

+ As a Promoter looking to possibly collaborate with the label, the landing page must be enticing and interesting as the first impression must be an accurate representation of the label they are looking to do business with.

+ As a new user every detail for the landing page will create an identity, therefore it must be minimal but informative on what the label is about. Similar to promoters new users will be subconsciously looking for positive first impressions.


# Discography Page User Story

+ As an existing fan, the discography page must contain links to music that are new. In addition, informing the users of upcoming releases is equally as important.

+ As a promoter, the discography page must provide new and old music for the user to have a broader understanding of the label he or she is planning to promote.

+ As a new user, this will be the deciding factor on whether on not they become a fan of the label. This will be  the way 


# Merchandise Page User Story

+ As an existing fan looking to purchase from a label they know and love, the merch page must contain the products that are expected to be released from a record label.


+ As a promoter, a label that not only releases music but even operates like a business with products for sale, is a great way to convince them to bring their talents to the team. This shows the label versatility and constant engagement for its fans.

+ As a new user the combination


# Contact Page User Story

+ As a promoter, new user and existing fan, this page must have a clear and concise contact form to make it as easy as possible for them to get a hold of people within the label. Furthermore, information on the label headquarters location as well as phone number will make the label even more accessible.


# Features

+ Landing page
+ Discography page
+ Merchandise page
+ Contact page

Navbars are arguably the most important part of any website, navigation and accessibility are pivotal when creating a website. A Navbar is used across all pages of the site, this in turn allows users to efficiently navigate through the website regardless of where they may be the page. I have relocated social media links to the footer of each page for mobile users. Furthermore, the landing page will contain a logo link to the merch page. 

# Land page

+ The landing page will contain an enlarged image of the Robust Sounds record label logo to reinforce this labels identity. A complementary background image will be placed behind it to give the home page a more satisfying feel to it. This page will have the links and navbars as stated above.

+  The landing page will also have the label logo in the footer, however it will be a link to the merchandise page. This  will be perfect for mobile users and to increase sells.
# Discography Page

+ The discography page will contain a number of tracks previously made by the label itself. It will also contain snippets of upcoming tracks and projects the label is working on to build up excitement.

# Merchandise Page

+ Merchandise page will contain products like posters of previous album covers/stickers and posters. Viewers will be able to purchase merchandise securely using the PayPal 'Buy Now' button.

# Contact page

+ Contact Page will once again reinforce the social media links that can be found on landing and discography pages. However, users will be able to contact the label for their specific needs. General enquires, Collaboration enquires, complaints and queries regarding merchandise or anything else relating to their needs.


## Typography

The “Freckled” Face” font is the main font used throughout the website, it gives a more stylish yet casual feel to the website and label.
